# x - code - accessibility

Accessibility is about reaching the most human possible.

## Where to use accessibility

### Language choice

*   [ ] Write in a clear, concise tone without using complex vocabulary when
itâ€™s not necessary.

*   [ ] Try to translate your text in another language to see if there is some
words that don't translate very well.

### Screen readers

### Visuals

*   [ ] Avoid text in images, prefer translatable text (ideally even in
diagrams). If you do, include a visual aid and a text description.

*   [ ] Avoid text in svg. The browser can't translate the text without
refreshing the whole page.

### Typography

*   [ ] Avoid script text as it can be confusing for people who aren't fluent
in the language.
