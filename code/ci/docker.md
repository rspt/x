## Container management

### Rancher

#### Adding a custom private library to catalog

1.  exec into your rancher server container (`docker exec -i -t <container-id> /bin/sh`)
2.  `ssh-keygen`
3.  provide id_rsa.pub to your git repo
4.  `cd /var/lib/cattle/DATA`
5.  `mkdir <catalog-alias>`
6.  `git clone <your repo> <catalog-alias>`
7.  add the git repo to Rancher via the webUI using the same catalog alias and git URI you used above.

There is an open issue for this feature: [https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/3248](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/3248)
